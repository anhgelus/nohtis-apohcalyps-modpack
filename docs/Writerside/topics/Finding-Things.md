# Finding Things

The world is devastated, and you are too weak to collect your own stuff.
You have to find all you need in the world, without crafting it.

The best way to find stuff is to search loot in cities.
These cities are randomly generated, and some buildings can contain chests with stuff.

Another way to find what you need is to kill some zombies.
The zombies can drop sometimes some useful things.
