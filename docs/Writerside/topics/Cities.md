# Cities

Cities are spread all around the world.
These can have very different size: tiny to huge.

In the city, you can find some loot chests in buildings.
The loot's quality is determined by the emplacement of the chest.
The more the chest is hard to find and dangerous to, the more the quality will be high.

## Highway

Lot of cities are connected to each other with multiple highways.
These look like a huge straight road.

## Metro train

You can find some metro station while exploring the city.
This station lead you to the metro (obviously).

If you follow the rails, you will find other station in other cities, but the metro is very dangerous: many zombies live 
in it!
