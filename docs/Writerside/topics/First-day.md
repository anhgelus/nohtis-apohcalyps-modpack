# First day

The first day in Nohtis Apohcalyps may be a little bit rough.
Having some difficulties to survive is usual, specially if you never played before.

Nohtis Apohcalyps is a complex modpack, and it will be always hard to survive.

The first day you have to focus on finding:
- food and water
- more ammunition, guns, etc.
- a "safe" place to spend the night

You also have to understand how the most important mechanics work.

This tutorial is here to help you with these goals.
