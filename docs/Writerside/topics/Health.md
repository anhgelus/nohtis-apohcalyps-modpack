# Health

The health was entirely modified by Nohtis Apohcalyps.

It is more realistic and hardcore than the vanilla mechanic.

## Heal points

Every part of your corpse has its own heal points.

When you lose heal points, it will give you an effect linked with the lost points (e.g. slowness for the feet).

If you lose all your HP in the body or in the head, you will die.

## Healing

You can restore your HP with some specific stuff like bandage or plaster.

To heal you with a bandage or a plaster, you have to put the item in your hand and right click.
A GUI will be opened, and it will show you every part of your corpse.
You can select the part that you want to heal.
A plaster will increase the health by 2 points (1 heart) and it will be 4 points (2 heart) for the bandage.

The health is not regenerated instantly.
You have to wait one or two minutes to regain the heart.
