## World creation

When you create a new world, you don't have to worry about the world generation because everything is already set up.

## Server set up

You just have to run the modpack inside Docker with 
[this configuration](https://github.com/anhgelus/nohtis-apohcalyps-modpack/tree/main/modpack/docker).

Not using Docker is not supported yet because the installer tool provided to install Modrinth modpack for servers doesn't
support yet Forge.

The `server.properties` is generated by the modpack.
If the voice chat doesn't work, check this [documentation](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/server_setup).
