# Guns and Ammunition

You got a simple pistol and little ammo.
You must find more ammunition and better guns if you want to survive in the apocalypse.

Basic ammo can be dropped by the zombies, same for the gun, but if you want better gears you have to search a city.
In the city you will find some chests, and if you are lucky you will find some interesting gears...
