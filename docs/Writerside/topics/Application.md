# Application

If you already know how to install this type of modpack, you can skip this section.

To install the modpack, you have to install one of these applications:
- [Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app), the official app by Modrinth
- [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org), a fork of MultiMC with better supports of mods
- [MultiMC](https://multimc.org), a custom launcher designed by a Mojang employee
- [and others](https://docs.modrinth.com/modpacks/play)

## Modrinth App

Install the app.
Click on the `Browse` button (the magnifying glass) on the left side.
Search `Nothis Apohcalyps` and click on `Install`. 
Now you can start the modpack.

## Prism Launcher and MultiMC

After installing [one of these launchers](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/wiki/Getting-Started#initial-setup) and 
[Java](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/installing-java/) *(Java 8 for 1.16.5, Java 17 for 1.18 and later)*,
you have to log in with your Microsoft account.

The launcher will download every mod, install Forge and everything needed. 
You can now start the modpack by double-clicking on it.
